## **16. 3Sum Closest (Medium)** 

https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/



#### Ideas : 

1. Every element has a chance to become the first candidate (index 0 to index length-3)
2. Sort `nums` to make tow pointer method works
3. New target is `target - first candidate`which is equal to `second + third candidate`
4. Get the closest answer from the rest of vector by two pointer in both sides



#### Solution 1 :

Language : C++

```C++
class Solution 
{
public:
    int threeSumClosest(vector<int>& nums, int target) 
    {
        sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        int n = nums.size(), diff = INT_MAX, ans;
        
        for(int i=0; i<n-2; ++i)
        {
            int second = i+1, third = n-1;
            while(second < third)
            {
                int sum = nums[i] + nums[second] + nums[third];
                
                if(target == sum)
                    return target;
                if(target > sum)
                    second++;
                    
                else
                    third--;
                
                if(diff > abs(sum - target))
                {
                    diff = abs(sum - target);
                    ans = sum;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
