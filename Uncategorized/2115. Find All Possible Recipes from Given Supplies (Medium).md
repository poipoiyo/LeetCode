## 2115. Find All Possible Recipes from Given Supplies (Medium)


https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-possible-recipes-from-given-supplies/description/


#### Ideas
1. Find the recipes can be made with provide supplies. The problem is similar with course sequence problem, which can be solved by Kahn to count  degrees.
2. Initialize all recipes degree to zero. 
3. Traverse all recipes and supplies. If the recipes cannot be made right now, increase the degree, and build an edge from recipe to not exist supply.
4. Traverse all degrees. If there is a zero degree, push it to the queue, which means they can be used for next round.
5. While there is element in queue, keep reduce recipes degree until zero. Once the recipe can be made, keep pushing it to queue for next round.

#### Solution
```C++
class Solution {
public:
  vector<string> findAllRecipes(vector<string>& recipes, vector<vector<string>>& ingredients, vector<string>& supplies) {
    int n = recipes.size();
    unordered_map<string, vector<string>> graph;
    unordered_map<string, int> degree;
    for(auto recipe : recipes)
      degree[recipe] = 0; 

    for(int i=0; i<recipes.size(); i++) {
      for(int j=0; j<ingredients[i].size(); j++) {
        if(find(supplies.begin(), supplies.end(), ingredients[i][j]) == supplies.end()) {
          // need an edge from ingredient to recipe
          degree[recipes[i]]++;
          graph[ingredients[i][j]].push_back(recipes[i]);
        }
      }
    }

    // KAHN
    queue<string> q;
    for(auto i : degree) {
      if(i.second == 0)
        q.push(i.first);
    }

    vector<string> ans;
    while(!q.empty()) {
      string cur = q.front();
      q.pop();
      ans.emplace_back(cur);

      for(auto i: graph[cur]) {
        degree[i]--;
        if(degree[i] == 0) 
          q.push(i);
      }
    }
    return ans;
  }
};
```
