## 440. K-th Smallest in Lexicographical Order (Hard)


https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-smallest-in-lexicographical-order/description/


#### Ideas
1. Return the kth lexicographically smallest integer in the range [1, n]
2. To return kth value, we have to count all possibilities for current value.
3. For example, for `n = 15`, the count for `i = 1` would be 1, 10, 11, ..., 15.
4. If current count is enough, we don't have to move to another number. Stay at 1, and go for next level until its found.
5. If current count is not enough, minus current count, and go for next number. Go to 2, and check count again.

#### Solution
```C++
class Solution {
public:
  int findKthNumber(int n, int k) {
    int cur = 1;
    k--;

    while(k > 0) {
      // check range for current step
      int count = Count(n, cur, cur+1);
      if(count <= k) {
        // all possible cannot match solution, go to next
        cur++;
        k -= count;
      }
      else {
        // solution can be found, go deeper
        cur *= 10;
        k--;
      }
    }
    return cur;
  }

  int Count(int n, long int cur, long int next) {
    int steps = 0;
    while (cur <= n) {
      steps += min((long)n + 1, next) - cur;
      // move to next level
      cur *= 10; 
      next *= 10;
    }
    return steps;
  }
};
```
