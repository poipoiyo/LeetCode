## 2560. House Robber IV (Medium)


https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iv/description/


#### Ideas
1. The problem is different from other house robber. Normally, we would like to have as large value as we can have. In this problem, binary search can be used to get the samllest value.
2. Assume the minimun return value, and check numbers of valid houses. If current house can be taken, increase index as well. (Cannot take adjcent house)
3. Return the exact guessing number.

#### Solution
```C++
class Solution {
public:
  int minCapability(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int left = 1, right = 1e9, n = nums.size();
    while(left < right) {
      int mid = (left+right)/2, takes = 0;
      for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
        if(nums[i] <= mid) {
          takes++;
          i++;
        }
      }
      if(takes >= k)
        right = mid;
      else
        left = mid+1;
    }
    return left;
  }
};
```
