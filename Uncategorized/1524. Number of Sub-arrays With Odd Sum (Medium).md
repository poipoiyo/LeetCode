## 1524. Number of Sub-arrays With Odd Sum (Medium)


https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-sub-arrays-with-odd-sum/


#### Ideas
1. We can use dynamic program to count it. Also, the issue can be solved by prefix sum.
2. For digit element, if current prefix sum is even, odd sum will only be added if current element is odd.
3. On the other hand, if current prefix sum is odd, odd sum will only be added if current element is even.
4. Since we only care those case, record current odd and even prefix sum, and update answer for every element.

#### Solution
```C++
class Solution {
public:
  int numOfSubarrays(vector<int>& arr) {
    int odd = 0, even = 0, ans = 0;      
    for(auto n: arr){
      even += 1;
      if(n%2 == 1)
        swap(odd, even);
      ans = (ans+odd)%1000000007;;
    }
    return ans;
  }
};
```
