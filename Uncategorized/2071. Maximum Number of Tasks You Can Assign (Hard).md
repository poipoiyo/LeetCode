## 2071. Maximum Number of Tasks You Can Assign (Hard)


https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-tasks-you-can-assign/


#### Ideas
1. Find numbers of task can be assigned for valid workers, and there are some pills to increase workers.
2. It is a greedy and binary search problem, and we are going to find the largest middle number (completed task)
3. Sort `tasks`, `workers` first, and start binary search for smaller length.
4. Use multiset to record workers, so that we can erase workers who has task.
5. Try to find correspond task. For a task, a worker might complete it directly, or complete it with a pill, or cannot complete it at all.
6. Check if the task can be assigned with or without pill, and finally we can know this round can be completed or not, and go for next search.

#### Solution
```C++
class Solution {
public:
  int maxTaskAssign(vector<int>& tasks, vector<int>& workers, int pills, int strength) {
    int m = tasks.size(), n = workers.size();
    int ans = 0, low = 0, high = min(m, n);
    sort(tasks.begin(), tasks.end());
    sort(workers.begin(), workers.end());
    while(low <= high) {
      int mid = low + (high-low)/2, count = 0;
      bool flag = true;
      multiset<int> st(workers.begin(), workers.end());

      // Checking if the mid smallest tasks can be assigned
      for(int i=mid-1; i>=0; i--) {
        auto it = prev(st.end());
        if(tasks[i] <= *it)
          // Assign without pills
          st.erase(it);
        else {      
          // Try to assign with pills
          auto it = st.lower_bound(tasks[i] - strength);
          if(it != st.end()) {
            count++;
            st.erase(it);
          } 
          else {        
            // Cannot assign
            flag = false;
            break;
          }
        }

        if(count > pills) {
          flag = false;
          break;
        }
      }

      if(flag) {
        ans = mid;
        low = mid+1;
      }
      else
        high = mid-1;
    }
    return ans;
  }
};
