## **287. Find the Duplicate Number (Medium)** 

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/



#### Ideas 1: 

1. All elements are in range `[1, nums.size()]` and not allow to modify `nums`.
2. Count the number of elements which are less than `0.5 * nums.size()`. If there is a duplicate number in `nums`, we can use the counting number to judge which part contains the duplicate one. 
3. In solution 1, we use this method to shorten the range of `nums`.



#### Ideas 2:

1. The other way treats `nums` as a cycled list. 
2. Since the elements are less than the length, we can traverse it by keeping calling `nums[nums[index]]`.
3. In solution 2, set two pointer - `slow` and `fast`. Find the entrance of the cycle and let slow in the cycle. 
4. Secondly, we let fast start at the beginning. Once they meet each other, it must be the duplicate number.





#### Solution 1 :

Language : C++

```C++
class Solution 
{
public:
    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) 
    {
        int start = 0, end = nums.size()-1;
        while(start < end)
        {
            int mid = (end - start) / 2 + start, count = 0;
            for(int num : nums)
                if(num <= mid)
                    ++count;
            
            if(count<=mid)
                start = mid+1;
            else
                end = mid; 
        }
        return start;
    }
};
```



#### Solution 2 :

Language : C++

```C++
class Solution 
{
public:
    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) 
    {
        int slow = nums[0], fast = nums[slow];
        while(slow != fast)
        {
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[nums[fast]];
        }
        
        fast = 0;
        while(fast != slow)
        {
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[fast];        
        }
        return slow;
    }
};
```
