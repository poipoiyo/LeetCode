## **394. Decode String (Medium)** 

https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/



#### Example :

```
Input: s = "3[a2[c]]"
Output: "accaccacc"
```



#### Ideas : 

There are 4 cases in s:
1. digit : 
	Since there will always be a `"["` after digit, we have to memorize the number. If the number is larger than 10, the recording should be `number = preNum * 10 + (character-'0')` 
	
2. character : 
	It's part of the answer, but it changed when it comes to `[]`. Record it temporarily at the top of the stack which can be added immediately.

3. "[" :
	It's the start of new substring, we should push the previous and the empty string to the stack. Coming character can be added to the empty string, and the number should be reset.

4. "]" :
	It means the end of the substring. We pop out the top of the stack to add substring into the answer.



#### Solution 1

Language : C++

```C++
class Solution 
{
public:
    string decodeString(string s) 
    {
        stack<pair<int,string>> stk;
        stk.push({1,""});
        
        int num = 0;
        for(char c : s)
        {
            if (isdigit(c))
                num = num*10 + int(c-'0');
            else if(c=='[')
            {
                stk.push({num,""});
                num = 0;
            }
            else if(c==']')
            {
                int times = stk.top().first;
                string subString = stk.top().second;
                stk.pop();
                for(int i=0; i<times; ++i)
                    stk.top().second += subString;
            }
            else
                stk.top().second += c;
        }
        
        return stk.top().second;
    }
};
```
