## **338. Counting Bits (Easy)** 

https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/



#### Example :

| < 2^1         | < 2^2         | < 2^3         | < 2^4          |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| 0 = 0000 -> 0 | 2 = 0010 -> 1 | 4 = 0100 -> 1 | 8 = 1000 -> 1  |
| 1 = 0001 -> 1 | 3 = 0011 -> 2 | 5 = 0101 -> 2 | 9 = 1001 -> 2  |
|               |               | 6 = 0110 -> 2 | 10 = 1010 -> 2 |
|               |               | 7 = 0111 -> 3 | 11 = 1011 -> 3 |
|               |               |               | 12 = 1100 -> 2 |
|               |               |               | 13 = 1101 -> 3 |
|               |               |               | 14 = 1110 -> 3 |
|               |               |               | 15 = 1111 -> 4 |



#### Ideas : 

1. Digits only shift to right when it doubled, for example : `3 -> 6 -> 12`, always remains `answer = 2`

2. Reversely , the answer of even number n can be derived by the answer of n/2

3. When it comes to odd number n, the answer is the answer of n/2 and plus 1, for example : `ans[5] = ans[2] + 1`



#### Language : C++

```C++
class Solution 
{
public:
    vector<int> countBits(int num)
    {
        vector<int> ans(1,0);
        for (int i=1;i<=num;++i) 
        {
            ans.push_back( ans[i/2] + i%2 );
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
