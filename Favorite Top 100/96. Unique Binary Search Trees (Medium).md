## **96. Unique Binary Search Trees (Medium)** 

https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/



#### Ideas : 

1. It's a dynamic programming problem. Before getting the answer of n nodes tree, we should know the answer of n-1 nodes tree, such as the first loop in the solution.

2. A tree contains a root, left tree and right tree. To reach all the unique tree, we should let every node element be the root, and add every combination.

3. For example, `n=4`, should add the combination from `root = 1 to 4`. If `root=2`, the left side lefts element 1 and the right side lefts element 3, 4. The unique trees `root=2` should be the combination of left tree and right tree `dp[1]*dp[2]`.



#### Solution 1

Language : C++

```C++
class Solution 
{
public:
    int numTrees(int n) 
    {
        vector<int> dp(n+1,0);
        dp[0]=1;
        dp[1]=1;
        for(int i=2; i<=n; ++i)
            for(int root=1; root<=i; ++root)
                dp[i]+=dp[root-1]*dp[i-root];
        
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```
