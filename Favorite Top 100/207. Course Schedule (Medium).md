## **207. Course Schedule (Medium)** 

https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/



#### Ideas 1: 

1.  Treats course as a graph, and the goal is to check whether edges are cycled or not.
2. Solution 1 is based on DFS. Saving required courses in adjacent vector, and making tags for each of them. 
3.  If the course has been tagged before, there is a cycle.



#### Ideas 2:

1.  Solution 2 is based on BFS. Saving required courses in adjacent vector, and setting degree for for each of them. 
2.  Degree shows how many courses it required, and 0 degree is beginning of the graph.
3.  Start from the beginning courses, and reduce the degree gradually. Check if there still some courses haven't took yet.





#### Solution 1 :

Language : C++

```C++
class Solution 
{
public:
    bool canFinish(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) 
    {
        vector<vector<int>> adjacent(numCourses);
        for(auto edge : prerequisites)
            adjacent[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
        
        vector<int> visit(numCourses);
        for(int i=0; i<numCourses; i++)
            if(isCycle(adjacent, visit, i))
                return false;
        
        return true;
    }
    
    bool isCycle(vector<vector<int>> &adj, vector<int> &vis, int i)
    {
        if(vis[i]==1)
            return true;
        
        if(vis[i]==0)
        {
            vis[i] = 1;
            
            for(auto edge : adj[i])
                if(isCycle(adj, vis, edge))
                    return true;
        }
        vis[i] = 2;
        
        return false;
    }
};
```



#### Solution 2 :

Language : C++

```C++
class Solution 
{
public:
    bool canFinish(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) 
    {
        vector<vector<int>> adj(numCourses, vector<int>());
        vector<int> degree(numCourses, 0);
        for (auto p : prerequisites) 
        {
            adj[p[1]].push_back(p[0]);
            degree[p[0]]++;
        }
        
        queue<int> q;
        for (int i=0; i<numCourses; i++)
            if (degree[i] == 0) 
                q.push(i);
        
        while (!q.empty()) 
        {
            int curr = q.front(); 
            q.pop(); 
            numCourses--;
            
            for (auto next : adj[curr])
                if (--degree[next] == 0) 
                    q.push(next);
        }
        return numCourses == 0; 
    }
};
```
