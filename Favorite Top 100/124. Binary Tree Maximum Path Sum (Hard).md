## **124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum (Hard)** 

https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/



#### Ideas : 

1.  It takes left path, right path, and a root value to build a complete path.
2.  The left(right) path might be negative, so it's possible to not take any left node. The left value is `max(find_path, 0)`.
3.  If some nodes have been token, it's not able to take both side as usual. Because there will be a branch, we return `max(left_path, right_path)`
4.  In solution, we try every node as the middle root, and build path from both side. However, we return only one side value to avoid branch in next level.



#### Solution 1

Language : C++

```C++
class Solution 
{
public:
    int ans = INT_MIN;
    int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) 
    {
        Implement(root);
        return ans;
    }
    
    int Implement(TreeNode* t)
    {
        if(!t)
            return 0;
        int l = max(Implement(t->left), 0);
        int r = max(Implement(t->right), 0);
        
        int cur = t->val + l + r;
        ans = max(ans, cur);
        
        return t->val + max(l, r);
    }
};
```
