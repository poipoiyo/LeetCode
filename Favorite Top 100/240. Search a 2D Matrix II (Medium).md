## **240. Search a 2D Matrix II (Medium)** 

https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix-ii/



#### Ideas : 

1. We can use binary search to search every row vector but it cost too much time.
2. If we start search form left-top and right-down side, it's hard to judge way direction to go. For example, if start from` i = matrix[0][0]`, `matrix[1][0]` and `matrix[0][1]` are both larger than `i`.
3. We can start from the left-down or right-up side. For example, start from `i = matrix[0][n]` (the right-up side). 
4. If target is larger than `i`, we go left. If smaller, we go down. Once it is out of the matrix range, return false.




#### Solution 1 :

Language : C++

```C++
class Solution 
{
public:
    bool searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int target) 
    {
        int i = 0, j = matrix[0].size()-1;
        
        while(i < matrix.size() && j >= 0)
        {        
            if(matrix[i][j] == target)
                return true;
            
            if(matrix[i][j] < target)
                ++i;
            else
                --j;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
