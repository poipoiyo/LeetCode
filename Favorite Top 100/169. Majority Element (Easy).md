https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/



#### Ideas : 

1.  The number of majority element is more than half the length. The majority element will always win the vote.
2.  We count the votes for current candidate. No matter how the candidate changes, the majority element will win eventually. 



#### Solution 1

Language : C++

```C++
class Solution 
{
public:
    int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) 
    {
        int count = 0, candidate = 0; 
        for(int n : nums)
        {
            if(count == 0)
                candidate = n;
            if(n == candidate)
                ++count;
            else 
                --count;
        }
        return candidate;
    }
};
```
