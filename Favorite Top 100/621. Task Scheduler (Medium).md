## **621. Task Scheduler (Medium)** 

https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/



#### Example :

```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: 
A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B
```



#### Ideas : 

1. There are two situations, with idle and without idle. The latter one is the length of tasks.

2. To count the idle times, we should memorize the frequency of every task. The most frequent task controls the times of task cycle and internal control the length of the cycle.

3. For example, there are 2 cycles (3 times the most frequent minus 1) which contains three tasks (internal+1) and the final unfinished cycle which contains tasks A and B. It can be transfer to `(m-1)*(n+1)+c` in code.




#### Solution 1 :

Language : C++

```C++
class Solution
{
public:
    int leastInterval(vector<char>& tasks, int n)
    {
        if (n==0) return tasks.size();
        
        vector<int> v(26);
        for(char ch : tasks)
            v[ch-'A']++;
        
        int m = *max_element(v.begin(), v.end()), c = 0; 
        for (int i : v)
            c += (i == m) ? 1 : 0;
        
        return max((int)tasks.size(), (m-1)*(n+1)+c);
    }
};
```
