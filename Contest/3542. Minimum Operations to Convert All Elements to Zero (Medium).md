## 3542. Minimum Operations to Convert All Elements to Zero (Medium)


https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-convert-all-elements-to-zero/description/


#### Ideas
1. Stack helps to record numbers have been cleared.
2. If current number is less than top of stack, should go back until values are the same. Smaller numbers are cleared already.
3. If current number is larger, take a new operation to proceed that.

#### Solution
```C++
class Solution {
public:
  int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
    vector<int> s = {0};
    int ans = 0;
    for(int n: nums) {
      while(!s.empty() && s.back() > n )
        s.pop_back();
      if(s.back() < n) {
        ans++;
        s.push_back(n);
      }
      // if s.top == n, do nothing (n will be cleared)
    }
    return ans;    
  }
};
```
