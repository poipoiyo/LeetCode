## 3479. Fruits Into Baskets III (Medium)


https://leetcode.com/problems/fruits-into-baskets-iii/description/


#### Ideas
1. Always find the leftmost element for fruits. We can use segment tree to search for the biggest value and update it.
2. The segment can be used to count the segment sum or to get maximun or minimun value like this. 
3. Build the tree by following the condition, child node would be every fruit element, and the parent is the maximun value between child nodes. And build the left side and right
4. Treat tree as a vector, parent index is `i`, and left node index can be count as `2*i+1` and `2*i+2` for the right node.
5. While searching the value, search the left side and right side. The value is found if `low` is the same as `high`, and we would change current value, update the tree (build the tree again).
6. Return the sum of not found count.

#### Solution
```C++
class Solution {
public:
  vector<int> segTree;
  void build(vector<int>& baskets, int ind, int low, int high) {
    if(low == high) {
      segTree[ind] = baskets[low];
      return;
    }
    int mid = (low+high)/2;
    build(baskets, 2*ind+1, low, mid);
    build(baskets, 2*ind+2, mid+1, high);
    segTree[ind] = max(segTree[2*ind+1], segTree[2*ind+2]);
  }

  int search(int ind, int low, int high, int k) {
    if(segTree[ind] < k)
      return -1;
    if(low == high) {
      // the basket is used, update segment tree
      segTree[ind] = -1;
      return low;
    }

    int mid = (low+high)/2;
    int pos;
    if(segTree[2*ind+1] >= k)
      pos = search(2*ind+1, low, mid, k);
    else
      pos = search(2*ind+2, mid+1, high, k);

    segTree[ind] = max(segTree[2*ind+1], segTree[2*ind+2]);
    return pos;
  }

  int numOfUnplacedFruits(vector<int>& fruits, vector<int>& baskets) {
    int n=fruits.size(), ans = 0;
    segTree.assign(4*n, 0);
    build(baskets, 0, 0, n-1);

    for(auto fruit: fruits)
      if(search(0, 0, n-1, fruit) == -1)
        ans++;

    return ans;
  }
};
```
