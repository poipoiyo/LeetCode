## 3419. Minimize the Maximum Edge Weight of Graph


https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-the-maximum-edge-weight-of-graph/description/


#### Ideas
1. The question does not related to threshold, since graph should always takes the smallest edge, and all nodes should be connected.
2. Use binary search to limit the largest edge. With the limitation, build the graph by DFS.
3. If all nodes are contained, the limitation can be decreased until we find the target limitation.

#### Solution
```C++
class Solution {
public:
  int DFS(int i, int m, vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> &related, vector<int> &visited) {
    int res = visited[i] = 1;
    for (auto [j, w] : related[i])
        if (w <= m && !visited[j])
            res += DFS(j, m, related, visited);
    return res;
  }

  int minMaxWeight(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int threshold) {
    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> related(n);
    for(auto edge : edges) 
      related[edge[1]].push_back({edge[0], edge[2]});
    
    int l = 1, r = 1000001;
    while(l < r) {
      int m = (l+r)/2;
      vector<int> visited(n);

      if(DFS(0, m, related, visited) == n)
        r = m;
      else
        l = m+1;
    }

    return l == 1000001 ? -1 : l;
  }
};
```
