## **3371. Identify the Largest Outlier in an Array (Medium)**


https://leetcode.com/problems/identify-the-largest-outlier-in-an-array/description/


#### Ideas:
1. `nums` contains n elements, where exactly n - 2 elements are special numbers. One of the remaining two elements is the sum of these special numbers, and the other is an outlier.
2. Assume `a+b=c`, and all sums are `a+b+c=2c`.
3. Declare an unordered_map to record the frequent of 2*element. If outlier is removed, then frequent of rest elements(`c`) should be larger than 2.
4. Another corner case is when total sum twice is equal to the outlier item. Check its freq, greater than 2 that means even we remove one of them as outlier we have at least one more which can be the sum of remaining.
5. Return the max possible outlier.

#### Solution:
```C++
class Solution {
public:
  int getLargestOutlier(vector<int>& nums) {
    unordered_map<int, int> m;
    int sum = 0, ans = INT_MIN;
    for(auto n: nums) {
      sum += n;
      m[n*2] += 1;
    }

    for(auto n: nums) {
      int temp = sum-n;
      if(m[temp] >= 2 || (m[temp] == 1 && temp != n*2))
        ans = max(ans, n);
    }

    return ans;
  }
};
```
