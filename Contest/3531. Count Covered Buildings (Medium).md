## 3531. Count Covered Buildings (Medium)


https://leetcode.com/problems/count-covered-buildings/description/


#### Ideas
1. Return number of covered buildings, and a covered building has x, y coordinates containing by other buildings.
2. Use `unordered_set` to record all buildings correspond x to y, y to x relations.
3. Check if the building is covered by `equal_range`. A covered building will not find its coordinate as begin nor end. 

#### Solution
```C++
class Solution {
public:
  int countCoveredBuildings(int n, vector<vector<int>>& buildings) {
    int ans = 0;
    unordered_map<int, set<int>> mpx, mpy;
    for(auto &b: buildings) {
      mpx[b[0]].insert(b[1]);
      mpy[b[1]].insert(b[0]);
    }

    for(auto &b: buildings) {
      auto &itx = mpx[b[0]];
      auto &ity = mpy[b[1]];

      auto[downy, upy] = itx.equal_range(b[1]);
      auto[downx, upx] = ity.equal_range(b[0]);

      if(downy != itx.begin() && upy != itx.end() && 
        downx != ity.begin() && upx != ity.end())
        ans++;
    }
    return ans;
  }
};
