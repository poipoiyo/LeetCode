## 3592. Inverse Coin Change (Medium)


https://leetcode.com/problems/inverse-coin-change/


#### Ideas
1. It was told how many ways can make current number with current coins, and return crrent coins.
2. Use dp to simulate the coin combination. It represents there are `DP[i]` ways can reach total i by using coins so far, and `DP[0]` would be 1.
3. Traverse from 1 to total n. If dp is the same as we are told, ignore that.
4. If there is additional 1 for we are told, it represents there is a new coin i, that can be used.
5. With a new coin i, we have to consider the combination by using it, and we will add them up from i to n.
6. Otherewise, there is no solution for current i. (Not enough coin type)

#### Solution
```C++
class Solution {
public:
  vector<int> findCoins(vector<int>& numWays) {
    int n = numWays.size();
    // my[i] ways can reach total i using the coins in the basket so far
    vector<long long> my(n+1, 0);
    my[0] = 1;

    vector<int> ans;
    for(int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
      if(numWays[i-1] == my[i])
        continue;
      
      // add value as new coin to answer
      if(numWays[i-1] - my[i] == 1) {
        ans.push_back(i);
        for(int j=i; j<=n; j++)
          my[j] += my[j-i];
      }
      // no solution
      else 
        return {};
    }
    return ans;
  }
};
```
