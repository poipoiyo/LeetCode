## 3434. Maximum Frequency After Subarray Operation (Medium)


https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-frequency-after-subarray-operation/description/


#### Ideas
1. The goal is to count how many k will exist after one operation.
2. There must be a value will become k, and we will try every value and find the max possible value, except original k.
3. For every value, 1 to 50, except k, count current value in `nums`. Plus 1 if matched, and minus 1 if meets k. Because the operation may be between k, we should consider to keep current k or not.
4. For every interval, record current max. For every number (1 to 50), record current value max. Finally there will be the most count for some value, and add it to original k.

#### Solution
```C++
class Solution {
public:
  int maxFrequency(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int countk = count(nums.begin(), nums.end(), k), mx = 0;

    for(int i=1; i<=50; i++) {
      if (i == k) 
        continue;

      int cur = 0, curmx = 0;
      for(int n: nums) {
        if(n == i)
          cur += 1;
        else if(n == k)
          cur -= 1;
        cur = max(cur, 0);
        curmx = max(curmx, cur);
      }
      mx = max(curmx, mx);
    }
    return mx+countk;
  }
};
