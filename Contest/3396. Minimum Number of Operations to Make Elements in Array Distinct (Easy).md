## **3396. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Elements in Array Distinct (Easy)**


https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-make-elements-in-array-distinct/description/


#### Ideas
1. The goal is to remove 3 elements to make `nums` distinct.
2. To find the latest duplicate element, or to find the first element from the end.
3. If there is a duplicate, return the order for this section by counting ceil after dividing 3.

#### Solution
```C++
class Solution {
public:
  int minimumOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
    int ans=0;
    vector<int> freq(101, 0);
    for(int i=nums.size()-1; i>=0; i--) {
      if(++freq[nums[i]] > 1)
        return ceil((double)(i+1)/3);
    }

    return 0;
  }
};
```
