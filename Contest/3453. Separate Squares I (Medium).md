## 3453. Separate Squares I (Medium)


https://leetcode.com/problems/separate-squares-i/description/


#### Ideas
1. The problem is to separate the square, and difficult part is error should be less than 1e-5.
2. Find the highest and lowest y-axis, and use binary search to find target line.
3. Difference between noraml binary search would be `high-low > 1e-5`. For every middle line, count the area to check if it match target.

#### Solution
```C++
class Solution {
public:
  double separateSquares(vector<vector<int>>& squares) {
    double area = 0, high = 1e-18, low = 1e18;

    for(auto sq:squares) {
      area += (double)sq[2]*sq[2];
      high = max(high, (double)(sq[1]+sq[2]));
      low = min(low, (double)sq[1]);
    }

    double target = area/2;
    auto calc = [&](double line) {
      double area = 0;
      for(auto& sq: squares) {
        double y = sq[1],  len = sq[2], top = y+len;
        if(line > y)
          area += (min(line, top) - y)*len;
      }
      return area;
    };

    while(high-low > 1e-5) {
      double mid = (high+low)/2;
      if(calc(mid) < target)
        low = mid;
      else
        high = mid;
    }

    return high;
  }
};
```
