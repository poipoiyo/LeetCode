## **274. H-Index (Medium)** 

https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/description/



#### Ideas : 
1. The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.
2. Sort `citations` first, and check if it matches condition from the small side.


#### Solution :
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        int n = citations.size();
        sort(citations.begin(), citations.end());
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            if(citations[i] >= n-i)
                return n-i;
        } 
        return 0;
    }
};
```
