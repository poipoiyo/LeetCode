## **135. Candy (Hard)** 


https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/description/


#### Ideas : 
1. Each child must have at least one candy, and higher rating gets more candies than their neighbors.
2. Assign 1 to all elements at first
3. For left to right, make sure higher right has one more candy than the left one
4. For right to left, make sure higher left has more candy. Current candy might be enough, or there should add one candy.


#### Solution :
```C++
class Solution {
public:
  int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {
    int n = ratings.size(), ans = 0;
    vector<int> candys(n, 1);

    for(int i=1; i<n; ++i) {
      if(ratings[i] > ratings[i-1])
        candys[i] = candys[i-1]+1;
    }

    for(int i=n-2; i>=0; --i) {
      if(ratings[i] > ratings[i+1])
        candys[i] = max(candys[i], candys[i+1]+1);
    }

    for(int candy : candys)
      ans += candy;

    return ans;
  }
};
```
